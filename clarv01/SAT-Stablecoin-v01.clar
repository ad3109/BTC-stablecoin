(define-constant (BITCOIN-PRICE-FEED u128) 0xabcdef123456789) ;; Address of the bitcoin price feed contract
(define-constant (BRENT-OIL-PRICE-FEED u128) 0x9876543210fedcba) ;; Address of the brent oil price feed contract

(define-constant (GOLD-WEIGHT u128) 30) ;; Weight of gold price in stablecoin calculation
(define-constant (BITCOIN-WEIGHT u128) 40) ;; Weight of bitcoin price in stablecoin calculation
(define-constant (BRENT-OIL-WEIGHT u128) 30) ;; Weight of brent oil price in stablecoin calculation

    ;; this contract defines the addresses of the three price feed contracts and their respective weights in the SAT price 
    ;; calculation. Then defines a public function get-stablecoin-price that calls each price feed contract to get 
    ;; the current price, calculates the weighted average of the prices, and returns the result as the SAT stablecoin price.
