;; This contract has 4 constants: the addresses of the three price feed contracts and the stablecoin contract. 
;; The get-average-price function calls the get-current-price function on each of the price feed contracts, adds 
;; the results together, calculates the average price, and then mints that amount of stablecoin by calling the mint 
;; function on the stablecoin contract
