# The Stable Asset Token - SAT, A Commodity Basket Stablecoin

Thesis: 
SAT is a commodity basket stablecoin named after SAToshi Nakamoto with one purpose - the buying/selling of spot (not futures) commodities via a marketplace we call CAT 
(Commodity Asset Tokens) Network. SAT is an over-collateralized basket stablecoin minus any fiat - the basket consists of strategic commodities - like gold, oil, gas, 
bitcoin, etc. Aggregate price will be the 1913 peg of $100 USD. SAT's street value is just an average price of the commodities in the basket, but it's still a hard peg because other 
commodities that have historically been used as money can be vaulted/audited (ie. gold, silver, bitcoin). The basket approach keeps the price fair and decentralized whilst putting hard 
money in its' rightful place as money again in a giant cross-border market.

Its' intended use is for:

1) P2P cash for a spot commodities marketplace (CAT - see link below) 
2) Defi for tokenized commodities exchanges for outside arbitrage and lastly,...
3) Tradfi for legacy commodities markets where live spot pricing is more appealing than regulated futures 

Target Customers: 
SAT is diversified to hold its' peg and specifically targets commodities markets where spot is more appealing and/or in regions where soverigns are looking to divest from 
USD; though it can be used as currency in many other scenarios. Commodities run the global economy because all products and services require them. Commodities are also the 
second larget market, second only to stocks. Strategic commodities are preferred over fiat simply becuase they are not bound by arbitrary physical regulation and hold 
significant off-chain value. 

So, when a person buys SAT the collateral behind it is held in BTC and physical gold/silver via 1:1 tokens like AUX, PAXG, etc but the price will be higher because of the other 
commodities in the basket- hence SAT must be over-collateralized in gold/silver/btc/other to hold a true aggregate price. The goal is to leverage partner exchange(s) for 
redemption since there will be transparent audits. Users confidence means the peg is auditable 24x7. It would be easier to make SAT a pure synthetic asset -because most traded commodities are 
never physically held anyway, but that goes against the whole idea of bringing back strong money. You need a real peg in the real world.

If we are successful, non-fiat stablecoin issuance will be a reality and crypto commodity volatility (ie. Bitcoin) will end as they will finally be used for their intended
purpose - P2P cash in a global marketplace with very large trade volume. Thus, the SAT project will fulfill Satoshi's goal for a universal P2P electronic cash system.
