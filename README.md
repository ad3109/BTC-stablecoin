# BTC-stablecoin
Thesis: A basket commodities stablecoin using BTC for:

1) P2P in a retail commodities marketplace 
2) Defi in a tokenized commodities exchange and lastly -
3) Tradfi in legacy commodities markets where live spot is more appealing then futures

We are building a fully collateralized commodities stablecoin that includes Bitcoin as part of the commodities basket. Our goal is to create a simple and 
reliable stablecoin minus fiat that can be used on and off-chain. If we are successful, this project will fulfill Satoshi's goal of a true P2P electronic 
cash system.
