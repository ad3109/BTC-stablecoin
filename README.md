# The Stable Asset Token - SAT, A Commodity Basket Stablecoin

Thesis: SAT is a basket commodities stablecoin using BTC, Gold, Oil, & TBD other strategic commodities for:

1) P2P cash for retail commodities marketplaces 
2) Defi for tokenized commodities exchanges and lastly,...
3) Tradfi for legacy commodities markets where live spot pricing is more appealing then futures

Our goal is to create a simple and reliable fully collateralized & auditable stablecoin that can be used for on and off-chain transactions. It is a hybrid 
stablecoin because some commodities are bought & sold via contracts, whilst others (Bitcoin & Gold) can be vaulted.  

SAT is diversified to hold its' peg and specifically targets commodities markets, though it can be used as currency in other scenarios. Commodities run the 
economy as all products and services require them. Commodities are also the second larget market, second only to stocks. Strategic commodities are
preferred over fiat simply becuase they are not bound by arbitrary physical regulation and hold significant off-chain value. 

If we are successful, Bitcoin's volatility will end as it will be used for its' intended purpose - P2P electronic cash. Thus, the SAT project will
fulfill Satoshi's goal for a universal P2P electronic cash system.
