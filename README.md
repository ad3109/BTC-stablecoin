# The Stable Asset Token - SAT, A Commodity Basket Stablecoin

Thesis: SAT is a basket commodities stablecoin using commodities like gold, oil, wheat, and other strategic commodities. Our goal is to create a simple and reliable fully collateralized & auditable stablecoin that can be used for on and off-chain transactions. It is a hybrid stablecoin because some commodities are bought & sold via contracts, whilst others (like gold) can be physically vaulted/audited. 

Its' intended use is for:

1) P2P cash for a spot commodities marketplace (CAT - see link below) 
2) Defi for tokenized commodities exchanges for outside arbitrage and lastly,...
3) Tradfi for legacy commodities markets where live spot pricing is more appealing than regulated futures 

Target Customers: SAT is diversified to hold its' peg and specifically targets commodities markets where spot is more appealing and/or in regions where
soverigns are looking to divest from USD; though it can be used as currency in many other scenarios. Commodities run the economy because all products and
services require them. Commodities are also the second larget market, second only to securities. Strategic commodities are preferred over fiat simply
becuase they are not bound by arbitrary physical regulation and hold significant off-chain value. 

If we are successful, non-fiat stablecoin issuance and crypto commodity volatility (ie Bitcoin) will end as they will be used for its' intended purpose - P2P electronic cash in a global marketplace with very large trade volume. Thus, the SAT project will fulfill Satoshi's goal for a universal P2P electronic cash system.
